Let\\'s assume \\$external_search_command is set to \\\"mairix_filter\\\", and mairix_filter is a script which runs the old but well loved mairix indexer with the arguments given to mairix_filter, in the \\\"raw\\\" mode of mairix, producing on the standard output a list of Message-IDs, one per line.\nIf possible, it also filters down the results coming from mairix such that only messages in the current folder remain. It can do this because it gets a hidden first argument which is the path to the folder. (This can be the type of clean and simple script called a *one-liner*.)\nNow if NeoMutt gets a limit or tag command followed by the pattern \\\"\\~I \\'-t s:bleeping=\\'\\\", mairix_filter runs mairix with the arguments from inside the quotes (the quotes are needed because of the space after \\\"-t\\\"), mairix finds all messages with \\\"bleeping\\\" in the Subject plus all messages sharing threads with these and outputs their file names, and mairix_filter translates the file names into Message-IDs. Finally, NeoMutt reads the Message-IDs and targets the matching messages with the command given to it.\nYou, the user, still have to rewrite the mairix_filter script to match the behavior of your indexer, but this should help users of indexers other than notmuch to integrate them cleanly with NeoMutt."
